# BIOL301L_Data
Data, Rcode and documents related to 301Lab

Across all files, I try to maintain a file consistent structure
 * _mgmt files will take raw data and convert it to rds or rda and store in data
 * _item files are data or objects which are useful
 * _analysis files do analyses
 * _tool files hold functions
 
Below the R files are listed with a breif description. Data files have corresponding mgmt files listed
